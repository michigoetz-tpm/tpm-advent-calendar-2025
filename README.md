# :christmas_tree: TPM Advent Calendar 2025
Technical Program Manager Advent Calendar 2025 - 24 Days of insights

🎄Growing up in Germany, December 1st meant one thing: open the 1st door of the advent calendar. This december I am lauchning the Technical Program Management Advent Calendar. 
Every morning, a small ritual. A moment of anticipation. A piece of chocolate or a tiny surprise before the day really started. The tech community has built their own versions - no chocolate, but knowledge and challenges. For TPMs I am translating this into daily treats of learning, one door at a time. 
December is tough. You are sprinting towards year-end while everyone's mentally waiting for the break. You don't have time for 3000 word essays or theoretical frameworks. You need tactical wins. Fast. 

Each post: 300 words max. One aciton item. Zero fluff. 24 days. 

Read it in 2 minutes over morning coffee. Implement it before lunch. Move on with your day.
